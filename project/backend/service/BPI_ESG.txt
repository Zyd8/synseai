Context Note: BPI ESG Alignment

BPI has integrated sustainability into its business since the 1980s and today follows a Board-approved Sustainability Agenda that combines Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles with measurable economic value (E₂) for stakeholders. This “ESG+E₂” formula means that sustainability is not just about compliance but also about creating tangible financial and social benefits.

BPI is fully aligned with local sustainability regulations. It complies with SEC Memorandum Circular No. 4 (2019) on sustainability reporting, and multiple Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) circulars on sustainable finance, environmental and social risk management, and ESG integration in banking and investment activities. These include Circulars 1085, 1128, 1149, 1185, and 1187.

Its Sustainability Strategy has two main pillars:

Responsible Banking → designing financial products and services that embed ESG criteria, promote inclusion, and support sustainable growth.

Responsible Operations → managing environmental and social resources responsibly in day-to-day operations.

Governance is strong: ESG is overseen at the Board and Committee level (Executive Committee, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, Risk Management Committee) and implemented by dedicated structures such as the Sustainability Office (agenda execution, reporting, and coordination) and the Environmental & Social Risk Management unit under Enterprise Risk Management.

Sustainability is embedded across the organization. Every business unit defines short-, medium-, and long-term Goals, Action Plans, and Metrics (GAMS). All employees are required to dedicate at least 10% of their performance targets to sustainability, and mandatory ESG training ensures consistent understanding across the bank. Each unit also has Sustainability Champions to lead ESG integration.

BPI has also made public commitments that go beyond compliance:

Coal Phase-Out Policy → No new financing for greenfield coal projects; coal exposure reduced by 50% by 2026 and 0% by 2032.

Ayala Sustainability Blueprint → Expand access to banking to 25% of the underbanked population.

Council for Inclusive Capitalism → Provide financial services to 5 million MSMEs and unbanked/underbanked Filipinos by 2030.

In summary, BPI demonstrates strong ESG alignment under its compliance obligations by adhering to regulatory frameworks, embedding ESG principles in its governance and risk management systems, operationalizing sustainability across the workforce, and committing to long-term sustainability goals that contribute to both financial and social impact.
